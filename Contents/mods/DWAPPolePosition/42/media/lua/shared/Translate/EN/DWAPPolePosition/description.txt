<CENTRE> <SIZE:medium> BRANDENBURG - NEW <LINE> <LINE>
<LEFT> <SIZE:small>  Brandenburg, nestled on the banks of the mighty Ohio, is a place that the finest folk of Kentucky call home! Buy a gift for that special someone in the Pondview Shopping Center, share a drink with a friend in the Outside Notes bar, or simply mix with the locals... there's something for everyone. And if you're feeling brave, why not book a tour of the Sunderland Hills Sanatorium over to the East?
